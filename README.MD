# Aigaion

Web based reference manager

## Announcement

Aigaion is a great reference manager, suitable for personal or corporate user. It is quite old but the concept behind it is very interesting and helpful.

The update process is slow because it is done on my free time but with community contribution I hope it can be maintained for a long time.

## Changelog

* 24/01/2021 - Some old PHP4 legacy code warnings fixed to work with PHP7.4
             - CREATE TABLE statements changed from MyISAM to InnoDB.
             - CodeIgniter framework updated from 2.1.0 to 2.2.6
* 2/10/2019 - Today the project was migrated to aigaion organization.
* 31/7/2019 - With pull request from @mahermanns, aigaion is able to run on modern php (>v7) by removing direct reference to mysql functions and migrating to mysqli lib.


## Requirements

* PHP up to 7.4 (thanks to @shinguz)
* MYSQL or MARIADB
* Webserver (Apache, Nginx, etc)

## Installation

Aigaion relies on modrewrite from web server. It comes with .htaccess suitable for apache.
Please modify as needed.
